    "While the models did not perform as well as I had hoped, there is still valuable insight to be gained from this report. First, the reason the models performed poorly is due to the inclusion of outliers. Although it is common knowledge outliers negatively impact any regression model, for the purpose of business analysis, it was critical to include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question moving forward should be, 'how should we handle the outliers?' From my perspective, I see two clear options. Option 1, offer 'cluster rate' health insurance premiums that have a maximum payout of the largest non-outlier maximum value. Keeping in mind this number will not be adequate for some customers, offer a different package (at a higher rate) for those that 'elect' to choose a different type of coverage. The second option is to do further research on the outliers to determine what _legal qualifying factor_ could place them in a separate category. Because preexisting conditions are protected by law, the research team needs to focus on any characteristic that the outlier group has in common that is not covered by law. (i.e. smokers vs non-smokers). \n",
    "\n",
    "This report should not be seen as the final word but rather the first step in making more informed decisions moving forward. I believe strongly, whether the board chooses to offer cluster rate insurance premiums as they are or proceed in further research, there will be many opportunities for data analysis in the future. I am confident small changes can make big differences in health insurance affordability as well as company profitability."
